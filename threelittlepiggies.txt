The Pigs and Their Houses:
Three little pigs decide to leave home and build their own houses.
The first pig builds a house of straw, the second uses sticks, and the third chooses bricks.
A big bad wolf, looking for a meal, approaches the first pig's straw house and demands to be let in.
The first pig refuses and runs to the second pig's house, which the wolf also blows down.
The wolf follows the two pigs to the third pig's brick house.
He huffs and puffs, but the strong brick house stands firm
